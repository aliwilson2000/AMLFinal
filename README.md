# AMLFinal Project: Video Captioning 

This project is part of the MSBA Advanced Machine Learning Class and involves the following students: Alicia Wilson, Anukul K Singh, Ambarish Narayan, Bhuvana Kothapalli, and Julia Peitsch.
The goal was to harness neural networks and different softwares to train and test a model that could feed videos (suitable for social media) and caption them with a specific 'flare.' 

Each file in this GitHub is part of the project, however, not all files were used in the final presentation/model. For example, the SubsetAMLFinal.ipynb was initially created to retrieve a subset of the UCF-50 categories. Notwithstanding, this subset was abandoned after we created a more extensive subset using the UCF-101 data.
